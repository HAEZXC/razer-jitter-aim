Jitter aiming is a technique used primarily in Apex Legends by mouse and keyboard players to manage recoil on fully automatic weapons. It involves rapidly moving the mouse in a small, consistent pattern—such as a tiny circle or side-to-side motion—at a speed that matches or exceeds the weapon's rate of fire.
 This rapid movement is theorized to exploit a game mechanic, potentially related to recoil smoothing, which can reduce or negate the visible recoil pattern, making the weapon easier to control at long range.
