Jitter aiming is a technique used primarily in Apex Legends by mouse and keyboard players to manage recoil on fully automatic weapons. It involves rapidly moving the mouse in a small, consistent pattern—such as a tiny circle or side-to-side motion—at a speed that matches or exceeds the weapon's rate of fire.
 This rapid movement is theorized to exploit a game mechanic, potentially related to recoil smoothing, which can reduce or negate the visible recoil pattern, making the weapon easier to control at long range.

The technique is most commonly applied to weapons with high recoil and slower fire rates, such as the Flatline, R301, and Rampage, where the consistent micro-movements can help maintain aim.
 Some players find it easier to use a diagonal back-and-forth motion or small circles, and it is recommended to match the rhythm of the weapon's fire rate for optimal results.
 However, jitter aiming is generally considered less effective or unnecessary for close-range engagements, where traditional recoil control is preferred.

Despite its popularity, jitter aiming is controversial. Critics argue it undermines the game's weapon balance, as it effectively removes the recoil penalty for powerful weapons like the Devotion, giving an unfair advantage in game modes like Control where such weapons are readily available.
 Furthermore, the technique can be physically taxing, potentially leading to strain or injury in the hand, wrist, and arm if performed excessively or beyond safe clicking limits.

There are also software tools, such as macros and scripts, available for automating the jitter aiming motion, which can be assigned to a key or button.
 However, using such macros may violate the game's terms of service and could result in a ban, as they are considered a form of automation or cheating.
 The use of these tools is not recommended, as it conflicts with fair play principles.

In contrast, some players advocate for mastering the natural recoil patterns of each weapon as a more skill-based and sustainable approach to accurate shooting, arguing that it provides better long-term control and consistency than relying on jitter aiming.
